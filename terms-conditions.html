                                                may cancel the special rights and/or conditions conferred to the Account due to its classification as Islamic Account, recall the designation of the Account as Islamic Account and render it a normal trading

                                                and &quot;orders&quot; have the same meaning. <br /> Types of Orders Accepted <br /> Some of the types of orders Leadcapital Corp Ltd accepts include, but are not limited to: <br /> a) Good till Cancelled
                                                (&quot;GTC&quot;) - An order (other than a market order), that by its terms is effective until filled or cancelled by Client. GTC Orders are not automatically cancelled at the end of the Business Day on
                                                which they are placed. <br /> b) Limit - An order (other than a market order) to buy or sell the identified market at a specified price. A limit order to buy generally will be executed when the ask price
                                                equals or falls below the bid price that you specify in the limit order. A limit order to sell generally will be executed when the bid price equals or exceeds the ask price that you specify in the limit
                                                order. <br /> c) Market- An order to buy or sell the identified market at the current market price that Leadcapital Corp Ltd provides via the Online Trading System. An order to buy is executed at the current
                                                market ask price and an order to sell is executed at the current market bid price. <br /> d) One Cancels the Other (&quot;OCO&quot;) - An order that is linked to another order. If one of the orders is executed,
                                                the other will be automatically cancelled. <br /> e) Stop Loss - A stop loss order is an instruction to buy or sell a market at a price which is worse than the opening price of an open position (or worse
                                                than the prevailing price when applying the stop loss order to an already open position). It can be used to help protect against losses. Please note that because of market gapping, the best available price
                                                that may be achieved could be materially different to the price set on the stop loss order and as such, stop loss orders are not guaranteed to take effect at the price for which they are set. <br /> f) Trailing
                                                Stop - A trailing stop is the same as a stop loss order with the only difference being that, instead of setting a price at which the order is activated, the trailing stop order is activated at a fixed distance
                                                from the market price. For example, if Client has purchased a long open position and the market ask price increases, the trailing stop price will also increase and will trail behind the market ask price
                                                at the fixed distance set by Client. If the market ask price then decreases, the trailing stop price will remain fixed at its last position and if the market ask price reaches the trailing stop price, the
                                                order will be executed. Please note that because of market gapping, the best available price that may be achieved could be materially different to the price set on the trailing stop order and as such, trailing
                                                stop orders are not guaranteed to take effect at the fixed distance for which they are set. Following submission of an order, it is your sole responsibility to remain available for order and fill confirmations,
                                                and other communications regarding your Account until all open orders are completed. Thereafter, you must monitor your Account frequently when you have open positions in the Account. <br /> Your order shall
                                                be valid in accordance with the type and time of the given order, as specified. If the time of validity or expiration date/time of the order is not specified, it shall be valid for an indefinite period.
                                                <br /> g) Gap - a break between prices that occurs when the price of an asset makes a sharp move up or down with no trading occurring in between. Gaps can be created by a number of factors including regular
                                                buying or selling pressure, earning announcements, or any other type of news release. If a market gaps through all orders will be filled on a best efforts basis at first available price (not order level).
                                                <br /> Currency of Trades <br /> Unless otherwise specified by LCC, all trades shall be made in United States Dollars (USD). <br /> Terms of Acceptance for Orders <br /> You can place an Order via LCC's
                                                Trading Platform. Once your instructions or Orders are received by LCC, they cannot be revoked, except with LCC's written consent which may be given at LCC's sole and absolute discretion. LCC shall have
                                                no liability for failure to execute orders. LCC shall have the right, but not the obligation, to reject any order in whole or in part prior to execution, or to cancel any order, where your Account contains
                                                funds that are insufficient to support the entire order or where such order is illegal or otherwise improper. <br /> LCC may, in certain circumstances accept instructions, by telephone via LCC's Dealing
                                                Room, provided that LCC is satisfied, at its full discretion, of your identity and LCC is further also satisfied with the clarity of instructions. In case of an Order received by LCC in any means other than
                                                through the Trading Platform, the Order will be transmitted by LCC to the Trading Platform and processed as if it was received through the Trading Platform. It is understood that an Order will not be affected.
                                                <br /> In the event that LCC wishes to confirm in any manner any instructions and/or Orders and/or communications sent through the telephone, it reserves the right to do so. You accept that there is a risk
                                                of misinterpretation or mistakes in the instructions or Orders sent through the telephone, regardless of what caused them, including, among others, technical failures. <br /> Execution Policy <br /> We are
                                                required to have an execution policy and to provide our clients with appropriate information in relation to our execution policy. LCC takes all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible results for its
                                                Customers. LCC's Best Execution Policy sets out a general overview on how orders are executed as well as several other factors that can affect the execution of a financial instrument. Where you place orders
                                                with us, the execution factors that we consider and their relative importance is as set out below: <br /> 1. Price. The relative importance we attach is &quot;high&quot;. <br /> 2. Speed. The relative importance
                                                we attach is &quot;high&quot;. <br /> 3. Likelihood of execution and settlement. The relative importance we attach is &quot;high&quot;. <br /> 4. Size. The relative importance we attach is &quot;high&quot;.
                                                <br /> We are the principal to every order you place with us and therefore we are the only execution venue. <br /> Authority <br /> We shall be entitled to act for you upon instructions given or purporting
                                                to be given by you without further enquiry as to the genuineness, authority or identity of the person giving or purporting to give such instructions provided such instruction is accompanied by your correct
                                                Account number and password. If your Account is a joint account, you agree that we are authorized to act on the instructions of any one person in whose name the Account is held, without further inquiry.
                                                We shall have no responsibility for further inquiry into such apparent authority and no liability for the consequences of any actions taken or failed to be taken by us in reliance on any such instructions
                                                or on the apparent authority of any such persons. <br /> Cancellation/withdrawal of instructions <br /> Orders may be cancelled via the LCC Online Trading System but we can only cancel your instructions
                                                if you explicitly request so, provided that we have not acted up to the time of your request upon those instructions. Executed instructions may only be withdrawn or amended by you with our consent. LCC shall
                                                have no liability for any claims, losses, damages, costs or expenses, including legal fees, arising directly or indirectly out of the failure of such order to be cancelled. <br /> Right not to accept orders
                                                <br /> We may, but shall not be obliged to, accept instructions to enter into a Transaction. If we decline to enter into a proposed Transaction, we shall not be obliged to give a reason but we shall promptly
                                                notify you accordingly. <br /> Control of orders prior to execution <br /> We have the right (but no obligation) to set limits and/or parameters to control your ability to place orders at our absolute discretion.
                                                Such limits and/or parameters may be amended, increased, decreased, removed or added to by us at our absolute discretion and may include (without limitation): <br /> 1. controls over maximum amounts placed
                                                to open a position using any of LCC's products; <br /> 2. controls over maximum positions placed per trader and per asset; <br /> 3. controls over our total exposure to you; <br /> 4. controls over prices
                                                at which orders may be submitted (to include (without limitation) controls over orders which are at a price which differs greatly from the market price at the time the order is submitted to the order book);
                                                <br /> 5. controls over the Electronic Services (to include (without limitation) any verification procedures to ensure that any particular order or orders has come from you); or <br /> 6. any other limits,
                                                parameters or controls which we may be required to implement in accordance with Applicable Regulations. <br /> Should you surpass the limits and/or parameter we set, your trade shall be blocked and/or suspended.
                                                <br /> The position limits will be notified in advance to you either through LCC's website or trading platforms. <br /> Trade Adjustments <br /> Clients must be aware that Forex transactions carry a high
                                                degree of risk. The amount of initial margin may be small relative to the value of the foreign currency so that transactions are 'leveraged' or 'geared'. A relatively small market movement may have a proportionately
                                                larger impact on the funds that the Client has deposited or will have to deposit. This may work against as well as for the client. Leadcapital Corp Ltd exclusively reserves the right to widen its variable
                                                spreads, adjust leverage, change its rollover rates and/or increase the margin requirements without notice under certain market conditions including, but not limited to, when the trading desk is closed,
                                                around fundamental announcements, as a result of changes in credit markets and/or at times of extreme market volatility. In such circumstances, the Client agrees to indemnify Leadcapital Corp Ltd for any
                                                and all losses that may occur due the widening of spreads and the adjustment of leverage. <br /> Furthermore, it should be noted that the Company operates on a 'negative balance protection' basis; this means
                                                that you cannot lose more than your initial investment. <br /> Execution of orders <br /> We shall use our reasonable endeavors to execute any order promptly, but in accepting your orders we do not represent
                                                or warrant that it will be possible to execute such order or that execution will be possible according to your instructions. If we encounter any material difficulty relevant to the proper carrying out of
                                                an order on your behalf we shall notify you promptly. <br /> Confirmations <br /> At the end of each trading day, confirmations for all Transactions that we have executed on your behalf on that trading day
                                                will be available via your online Account on our website. It is your responsibility to notify LCC if any confirmations are incorrect. Confirmations shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive
                                                and binding on you, unless you place your objection in writing within 5 Business Days. You may request to receive the Account statement monthly or quarterly via email, by providing such a request to LCC,
                                                but LCC is not obliged to provide you with the paper Account statement. The Account statement may be provided at the expense of the client. <br /> Cancellation of trades <br /> We have the right to reject
                                                an order or to cancel a transaction if we have adequate reasons/evidence that the following have occurred: <br /> 1. fraud/illegal actions that led to the transaction, <br /> 2. any instance when LCC has
                                                cause to believe that a person's trading activities may be illegal; <br /> 3. any instance where LCC may suffer any fiscal, regulatory, or pecuniary disadvantage by virtue of anyone's activities; <br />                                                4. any instance where one or more transactions are judged by LCC to have been performed in violation of this Agreement. <br /> 5.orders placed based on manipulated prices as a result of system errors or
                                                system malfunctions, <br /> 6.arbitrage trading on prices offered by our platforms as a result of systems errors; and <br /> 7.coordinated transactions by related parties in order to take advantage of systems
                                                errors and delays on systems updates. <br /> We reserve the right to cancel any and/or all trading positions and withhold and/or forfeit any profits incurred by the Customer on all the Customer's trades
                                                if we consider that that the Customer has engaged in market Arbitrage. <br /> Disabling and Cancelling Deposits <br /> We have the right not to accept funds deposited by you and/or to cancel your deposits
                                                in the following circumstances: <br /> 1. if you fail to provide LCC with any documents it requests from you either for client identification purposes or for any other reason; <br /> 2. if LCC suspects or
                                                has concerns that the submitted documents may be false or fake; <br /> 3. if LCC suspects you are involved in illegal or fraudulent activity; <br /> 4. if LCC is informed that your credit or debit card (or
                                                any other payment method used) has been lost or stolen; <br /> 5. where LCC considers that there is a chargeback risk; and <br /> 6. when you deposit $3,000 or more or if you make over 10 separate deposits
                                                to your trading Accounts and LCC is unable to verify your credit or debit card details or is unable to verify any other payment method used. <br /> In case of cancelled deposits, and if there is not a confiscation
                                                of your funds by a supervisory authority on the grounds of money laundering suspicion or for any other legal infringement, your funds will be returned to the bank account that have been initially received.
                                                <br /> Performance and settlement <br /> You will promptly deliver any instructions, funds, or documents deliverable by you under a Transaction in accordance with that Transaction as modified by any instructions
                                                given by us. <br /> Position limits <br /> We may require you to limit the number of open positions which you may have with us at any time and we may in our sole discretion close out any one or more Transactions
                                                in order to ensure that such position limits are maintained. <br /> Roll Over <br /> In certain market conditions you may be allowed to trade using the Roll Over feature. The Roll Over feature enables you
                                                to extend the expiration time of your trading position before it reaches the expiry date. This feature can be used subject to the following conditions: <br /> 1. An additional 30% of the initial deposit
                                                must be added automatically to your initial investment. <br /> 2. The Roll Over feature can only be used in cases where the progress of the followed price does not take the direction which you had anticipated.
                                                <br /> 3. You can only use the Roll Over feature once for each trading position. <br /> 4. The Roll Over feature shall only be available up to 15 minutes before the expiry time. <br /> Improper or Abusive
                                                Trading <br /> Leadcapital Corp Ltd's objective is to provide the most efficient trading liquidity available in the form of streaming, tradable prices for most of the financial instruments we offer on the
                                                trading platform. As a result of the highly automated nature of the delivery of these streaming, tradable prices, you acknowledge and accept that price misquotations are likely to occur from time to time.
                                                <br /> Should you execute trading strategies with the objective of exploiting such misquotation(s) or act in bad faith (commonly known as 'sniping'), Leadcapital Corp Ltd shall consider this as unacceptable
                                                behaviour. Should Leadcapital Corp Ltd determine, at its sole discretion and in good faith, that you or any representative of yours trading on your behalf is taking advantage, benefitting, attempting to
                                                take advantage or to benefit of such misquotation(s) or that you are committing any other improper or abusive trading act such as for example: <br /> a) fraud/illegal actions that led to the transaction;
                                                <br /> b) orders placed based on manipulated prices as a result of system errors or system malfunctions; <br /> c) arbitrage trading on prices offered by our platforms as a result of systems errors; and/or
                                                <br /> d) coordinated transactions by related parties in order to take advantage of systems errors and delays on systems updates. <br /> Then Leadcapital Corp Ltd will have the right to: <br /> 1) adjust
                                                the price spreads available to you; and/or <br /> 2) restrict your access to streaming, instantly tradable quotes, including providing manual quotation only; and/or <br /> 3) obtain from your account any
                                                historic trading profits that you have gained through such abuse of liquidity as determined by us at any time during our trading relationship; and/or <br /> 4) reject an order or to cancel a trade; and/or
                                                <br /> 5) immediately terminate our trading relationship <br /> Prohibited Trading <br /> No employee and/or former employee who currently works or used to work on a full time or part time basis for Leadcapital
                                                Corp Ltd or any of its related entities shall, during the term of the employee and/or former employee's service to Leadcapital Corp Ltd or any of its related entities and after termination of service become
                                                a client of any brand of Leadcapital Corp Ltd (either directly or indirectly, alone or with partners, associates, affiliates or any other third party) without Leadcapital Corp Ltd's prior written approval.
                                                Should Leadcapital Corp Ltd consider that the employee and/or former employee is trading with any brand of Leadcapital Corp Ltd without the Leadcapital Corp Ltd's prior written approval personally and/or
                                                via a third party we shall consider all the trading to be abusive and/or improper trading. In such circumstances the employee and/or former employee's trading account(s) and all open positions shall be closed
                                                immediately and any funds held within the account shall be confiscated. No business associate or former business associate of Leadcapital Corp Ltd or any of its related entities shall, during the period
                                                of the agreement between the associate/former business associate and Leadcapital Corp Ltd and after termination of such agreement, become a client of any brand of Leadcapital Corp Ltd (either directly or
                                                indirectly, alone or with partners, associates, affiliates or any other third party) without Leadcapital Corp Ltd's prior written approval. Should Leadcapital Corp Ltd consider that the associate/former
                                                business associate is trading with any brand of Leadcapital Corp Ltd without Leadcapital Corp Ltd's prior written approval personally and/or via a third party we shall consider all the trading to be abusive
                                                and/or improper trading. In such circumstances the relevant associate/former business associate's trading account(s) and all open positions shall be closed immediately and any funds held within the account
                                                shall be confiscated. <br /> Trailing Stop functionality in case that MT4 terminal is closed <br /> In the event that the MetaTrader 4 client terminal is closed, trailing stop will not work. This happens
                                                as the trailing stop works on the client terminal side and in this respect, if the client terminal is closed, only the stop loss that was placed by trailing stop before the closing of the terminal can trigger.
                                                <br /> Withdrawals <br /> Once your withdrawal request is approved, your withdrawal request will be processed by us and sent to the same bank, credit card or other source for execution on the same day that
                                                the request to withdraw funds was made, or the next working day if the client's request is received outside of normal trading hours. (Note: Some banks and credit card companies may take time to process payments
                                                especially in currencies where a correspondent bank is involved in the transaction). The funds will be returned to the bank account/credit card/other source from which the funds were debited. You are fully
                                                responsible for the payment details that you provided to LCC and LCC accepts no responsibility if you have provided false or inaccurate bank details. Further, withdrawals bare third party charges which may
                                                vary in accordance with the terms and conditions of the third parties. These charges may be verified upon request. <br /> The minimum withdrawal amount for all methods (excluding the wire transfer) is $20.
                                                The minimum withdrawal amount request for wire transfer is $100. Any withdrawal request for an amount below the two amounts mentioned above, will incur handling and processing charges as follows: minimum

                                                of your open positions, we will not comply with the request until you have closed sufficient positions to allow you to make the withdrawal. Withdrawals will only be made on request by you, by bank transfer
                                                to an account in your name or such other method as we, in our absolute discretion, may determine. <br /> In the event that it is not possible for the funds to be withdrawn without delay, LCC, in meeting
                                                its obligations to act in the client's best interest, will keep the client informed, including about the reasons for any delay and the expected timeframe before the funds will be withdrawn. Information provided
                                                to the client about any delays in withdrawing funds will be fair, clear and not misleading. <br /> LCC will endeavour to process your withdrawal requests promptly, however the time needed for the requested
                                                funds to be processed and appear in your account will depend upon the method used for depositing the funds and the third parties which are executing the payments. <br /> Stock Related Payouts on CFDs <br
                                                /> Payments on Stock Splits, Reverse Stock Splits, Stock Dividends and other Stock related events can have an impact on the share price and thus on the price of an equity based CFD. A person who holds a
                                                CFD position has no ownership of the underlying instrument. However, when a client holds a long CFD position, Leadcapital Corp Ltd shall pay the equivalent of the dividend to that client and deduct the equivalent
                                                from any client holding a short CFD position. This shall be done on or shortly after the ex-dividend date as that is when the economic effect is felt on the underlying share price. <br /> MT4 Trading Account

                                                closed positions; and/or 3. made a deposit into the Customers trading account; for a period of ninety (90) days and more, shall be classified by LCC as an Inactive Account (&quot;Inactive Account&quot;)
                                                where the Customer has and continues to: <br /> 1. place a trade; <br /> 2. open or close positions; and/or <br /> 3. make a deposit into the Customers trading account; <br /> the account shall be classified
                                                by LCC as an Active Account (&quot;Active Account&quot;) <br /> The Client further acknowledges and confirms that such Inactive Accounts will be subject to a monthly charge of $25 (or equivalent in other
                                                currencies), relating to the maintenance/administration of such Inactive Accounts. The Customer further agrees that any Inactive Accounts, holding zero balance/equity, shall be turned to Dormant (&quot;Dormant
                                                Account&quot;). In cases where your account remains Inactive for a period exceeding 12 months, an Annual Inactivity Fee shall apply, which will be deducted at a rate of one-hundred US Dollars ($100) or equivalent
                                                per quarter, minus any monthly inactivity fees already charged. The Annual Inactivity Fee may be charged by the Company at any point subsequent to the 12-month period being exceeded and applies retroactively.
                                                For re-activation of Dormant Accounts, the Customer must contact LCC's Customer Support Department and inform them of the Customer's wish to reactivate the Dormant Account. The Customer's Dormant Account
                                                will then be reactivated (subject to, if required, up-to-date Know Your Customer documentation provided to LCC by Customer) and become an Active Account. </p>

                                                with the requirements of the Client Money Rules. Margin deposits shall be made by wire transfer, credit card, e-wallet or by such other means as The Company may direct. <br /> Set-off on default <br /> If
                                                there is an Event of Default or this Agreement terminates, we shall set-off the balance of cash margin owed by us to you against your obligations (as reasonably valued by us). The net amount, if any, payable

                                                this clause (converted as required by applicable law into any other currency, any costs of such conversion to be borne by you, and (if applicable) deducted from any payment to you). Any Liquidation Amount
                                                not paid on the due date shall be treated as an unpaid such amount and bear interest, at the average rate at which overnight deposits in the currency of such payment are offered by major banks in the London

                                                as we shall reasonably select. <br /> Payments <br /> Unless a Liquidation Date has occurred or has been effectively set, we shall not be obliged to make any payment or delivery scheduled to be made by us
                                                under a Transaction for as long as an Event of Default or any event which may become (with the passage of time, the giving of notice, the making of any determination hereunder, or any combination thereof)
                                                an Event of Default with respect to you has occurred and is continuing. <br /> Additional rights <br /> Our rights under this clause shall be in addition to, and not in limitation or exclusion of, any other
                                                rights which we may have (whether by agreement, operation of law or otherwise). <br /> Application of netting to Transactions <br /> This clause applies to each Transaction entered into or outstanding between
                                                us on or after the date this Agreement takes effect. <br /> Single agreement <br /> This Agreement, the particular terms applicable to each Transaction entered into under this Agreement, and all amendments
                                                to any of them shall together constitute a single agreement between us. We both acknowledge that all Transactions entered into on or after the date this Agreement takes effect are entered into in reliance
